Welcome to LAWA!
----------------

LAWA is intended as a basic C++-framework for wavelet applications for PDEs, 
especially for adaptive methods. 

Key features of LAWA are:

- wavelet bases for different domains
- realizations of adaptive algorithms
- ease of use

Consequences of the design:

- extensibility
- flexibility



LAWA is still in continuous development. Several parts have reached some quite 
stable state whereas others still underly permanent change and improvements 
(especially design aspects). For more detailed information look at the 
__roadmap__.

To get started with LAWA, please see the 
__documentation__ which is intended as a developers guide or read about the 
__available features__.
