Reporting Bugs
--------------

Bugs should be found in nature, not in software. So if you find one of these
tiny beasties, be free to post on the mailing list.

To be able to handle such bug reports correctly and to be able to reproduce
the bug it is neccesary that you provide:

- a minimalistic test program producing the bug
- the exact command line invocation (all compiler options)
- the system, compiler information

We are thankful for every hint that helps to increase the code quality of LAWA!
