Installation of LAWA
--------------------

:document:  lawa::installation

LAWA is distributed as release to be downloaded from
the project-site at sourceforge (download lawa).

LAWA is currently bundled with a slightly modified version of FLENS. In the
long term the minor modifications will be integrated into FLENS so that the
standard version of FLENS will match the LAWA requirements. For the moment 
a suitable FLENS comes directly with LAWA. 

The installation of FLENS and LAWA on a Unix-like system (the only ones we give
installation support for) takes the following steps:

- Download and extract the release from the sourceforge __download site__. This will result
  in two folders in the current directory:
  
  ___ CODE __________________
  FLENS-lite
  LAWA-lite
  ___________________________
  
- You have to set two environment-variables pointing to the two project roots:

  ___ CODE __________________
  export FLENS_HOME=/path/to/the/flens/installation
  export LAWA_HOME=/path/to/the/lawa/installation
  ___________________________
  
  Probably you should place these two lines in one of `.bashrc` or `.profile`
  depending on your system to have the variables set automatically.
- Perhaps you have to/want to change some things in the `config`-file in the
  main directory of LAWA-lite. Here you can choose different settings for
    - the compiler you want to use
    - additional compiler flags
    - debug mode/release mode/profile mode
  The `config`-file is the only place where you can/should change such settings.
