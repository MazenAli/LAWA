A (coarse) feature matrix of LAWA
---------------------------------

:document:     lawa::features

In principle LAWAcan be divided in two main building blocks. General Wavelet 
Basis Constructions for different domains and adaptive wavelet algorithms.

Wavelets / Basis Constructions
------------------------------

LAWA is organized with respect to several rather orthogonal criteria. These
are mostly reflected by different template parameters. We show a summary of 
all currently available realizations of wavelet bases and some outlook.

First we take a look at the realizations of biorthogonal wavelet constructions 
available. The whole library is centered around biorthogonal wavelets; this is 
indeed the main focus.

+---------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------+
|   _domain_          | _construction_          | _status_                       |
+=====================+=========================+================================+
| R                   | CDF                     | final                          |
+---------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------+
| Periodic            | CDF                     | final                          |
+---------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------+
| Interval            | DKU, Primbs, Dijkema    | some minor polishing necessary |
+---------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------+
| $[0,1]^n$           | based on interval bases | working                        |
+---------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------+
| more general domain | based on interval bases | to be done yet (middle p.)     |
+---------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------+

For all these biorthogonal wavelet constructions we realized both the primal
and the corresponding duals for the B-splines and the wavelets.

LAWA provides different kinds of wavelets:

+---------------------+-------------------------+--------------------+--------------------------+
| _kind of wavelets_  | _domain_                | _construction_     | _status_                 |
+=====================+=========================+====================+==========================+
| orthogonal          |  R                      | Daubechies         | just coefficients, final |
+---------------------+-------------------------+--------------------+--------------------------+
| orthogonal          |  $[0,1]^n$              | Multiwavelets      | polishing to be done     |
+---------------------+-------------------------+--------------------+--------------------------+
| biorthogonal        | see table above         | see table above    | see table above          |
+---------------------+-------------------------+--------------------+--------------------------+
| semiorthogonal      | Interval                | BU                 | to be done yet (high p.) |
+---------------------+-------------------------+--------------------+--------------------------+

For the n-dimensional cube, and therefor especially also for the interval,
homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions or no/free boundary conditions have
been realized. Other boundary conditions could be easily added. Just a matter of
implementation time.
