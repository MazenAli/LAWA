LAWA: Library for Adaptive Wavelet Applications
-----------------------------------------------

LAWA is intended as a basic C++-framework for wavelet applications for PDEs, especially for adaptive methods.

Key features of LAWA are:
    -> wavelet bases for different domains
    -> realizations of adaptive algorithms
    -> ease of use

Consequences of the design:
    -> extensibility
    -> flexibility
