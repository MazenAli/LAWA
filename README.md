LAWA: Library for Adaptive Wavelet Applications
-----------------------------------------------

LAWA is intended as a basic C++-framework for wavelet applications for PDEs, especially for adaptive methods.

Key features of LAWA are:
    -> wavelet bases
    -> realizations of adaptive and low-rank algorithms for sparse approximations
    -> extensibility
    -> flexibility

In the present state the library is mostly undocumented, contains obsolete code, is not bug-free and is user-unfriendly.
I do not take any responsibility for damage to property or mental health.
