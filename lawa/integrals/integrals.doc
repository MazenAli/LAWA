==title: Integrals involving B-splines and/or wavelets==

Implementation of the calculation of integrals involving two factors.

==section: Template Parameters==
The declaration of [Integral] reads
==code:.cc==
template <typename T, 
          QuadratureType Quad,
          typename First, 
          typename Second>
struct Integral;
====
with template parameters:
==list:begin==
->[T]: Element type of involved integrands
->[Quad]: The quadrature type to be used
->[First]: The first factor in the integrand
->[Second]: The second factor in the integrand
==list:end==

Realized are versions where at least one factor is a B-spline or B-spline
wavelet.
