==title:The root class for all B-spline wavelets==
The root class for all B-spline wavelet types used in [LAWA].
This class is just empty since all implemented types of B-spline wavelets are
specializations of it. The distinction between different B-spline wavelet types
is realized by template parameters.

==section: Template parameters==
The declaration of [Wavelet] reads
==code.cc==
template <typename T,
          FunctionSide Side,
          DomainType Domain,
          Construction Cons=CDF>
struct Wavelet;
====
with template parameters
==list:begin==
->[T]:    the (numerical) element type (e.g. double)
->[Type]:    the kind of wavelet ([Primal] or [Dual])
->[Domain]:    the domain (e.g. [R], [Interval])
->[Cons]:    the underlying construction, by default [CDF] is chosen.
