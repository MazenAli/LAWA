==title: Primal MRA on the interval - Construction by Dahmen, Kunoth, Urban==

The construction by W. Dahmen, A. Kunoth and K. Urban (DKU) yields primal and dual
multiresolution analyses (MRAs) on the interval based on biorthogonal B-splines
and associated dual scaling functions. The MRAs are themselves the base for
the construction of biorthogonal B-spline wavelet bases on the interval).

The class realizing the primal MRA on the interval using the DKU construction is
 a specialization of the general {@lawa/mra}{[MRA]} class. The signature reads
==code.cc==
template <typename T>
    class MRA<T,Primal,Interval,DKU>;
====
with [FunctionSide=Primal], [DomainType=Interval] and [Construction=DKU] as
fixed template parameters.

==section: Essential properties==

==subsection: Index ranges==

The relevant index sets for [$\Phi_j = \{\varphi_{j,k}:k\in\mathcal{I}_j\}$]
where [$\mathcal{I}_j=\mathcal{I}^L_j\cup\mathcal{I}^I_j\cup\mathcal{I}^R_j$] are given by:
==latex==
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathcal{I}^L_j &:= &\{\ell-d,\dots,\ell-1\},\\
\mathcal{I}^I_j &:= &\{\ell,\dots,2^j-q-1\},\\
\mathcal{I}^R_j &:= &\{2^j-q,\dots,2^j-q+d-1\}.
\end{eqnarray*}
====
For [$\ell$] and [$q$] one yields (considering biorthogonality requirements):
==latex==
\begin{eqnarray*}
\ell & \geq & \tilde\ell_2-(\tilde{d}-d)\\
q & \geq & \ell+\mu(d)-1
\end{eqnarray*}
====
Here we assume that we first fixed the corresponding values for the dual
MRA as [$\tilde\ell := \tilde\ell_2$] and [$\tilde{q} = \ell+\mu(d)-1$].

==subsection: The minimal level==
The minimal level takes the value [min_j0] := [$\lceil\log_2(\tilde\ell+\tilde\ell_2-1)+1\rceil.$]

==subsection: Supports==
Since we have for the left boundary scaling functions
==latex==
$$\varphi_{j,r}^L := \sum_{m=1-\ell_2}^{\ell-1}\alpha_{r,m}\varphi_{[j,m]}|_{\R^+}, \qquad r=0,\dots,d-1$$
====
and for the right ones
==latex==
$$\varphi_{j,r}^R := \sum_{m=2^j-q}^{2^j\ell_1-1}\alpha_{j,r,m}^R\varphi_{[j,m]}|_{[0,1]}, \qquad r=0,\dots,d-1$$
====
we have [d] boundary scaling functions (at both interval ends). To get the support of all left boundary scaling functions we just have to consider the (maximal!) support of the rightmost one. Thus we get:
==latex==
\supp\ \varphi_{j,d-1}^L = [0,2^{-j}(\ell-1 + \ell_2)]
====
Analogously we get for the right end:
==latex==
\supp\ \varphi_{j,d-1}^R = [0,1-2^{-j}(q - \ell_1)]
====


==section: Constructors==

==subsection: Constructs MRA (given: d, d_, j)==

==coderef==
MRA(int d, int d_, int j0=-1);
====
Constructs a primal MRA based on [d] and [d_]. If no level [j0] is given as
argument the minimal possible level [min_j0] will be chosen otherwise [j0]
(assumes [j0]>=[min_j0]). [j0] is the minimal possible level during the lifetime
 of the MRA objectv then.

==section: Notes for Developers==

==subsection: alpha and beta==
The defintions of [$\alpha_{r,m}$] and [$\beta_{r,m}$] are according to the book
and NOT the original paper [DKU2] i.e. the roles of [$\alpha_{r,m}$] respectively [$\tilde\alpha_{r,m}$] are swapped. The same holds for [$\beta_{r,m}$]  and [$\tilde\beta_{r,m}$]. The calculations are straight
forward according to [DKU2] 5.1.
