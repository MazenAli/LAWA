==title:The root class for all B-splines==
The root class for all B-spline types used in [LAWA]. This class is just empty since all implemented types of B-splines are specializations of it. The distinction between different B-spline types is realized by template parameters.

==section: Template parameters==
The declaration of [BSpline] reads
==code.cc==
template <typename T,
          FunctionSide Side,
          DomainType Domain,
          Construction Cons=CDF>
struct BSpline;
====
with template parameters
==list:begin==
->[T]:    the (numerical) element type (e.g. double)
->[FunctionSide]:    the kind of B-spline ([Primal] or [Dual])
->[Domain]:    the domain (e.g. [R], [Interval])
->[Cons]:    the underlying construction, by default [CDF] is chosen.
