==title:Enumeration types used in LAWA==

==section:FunctionSide#FunctionSide==
Enumeration type to differentiate between primal and dual B-splines/wavelets.
We are open for suggestions concerning the typename [FunctionSide] ;-).
==code:.cc==
enum FunctionSide {
    Primal,
    Dual
};
====

==section:DomainType#DomainType==
Enumeration Type specifying the used domain.
==code.cc==
enum DomainType {
    Periodic,
    R,
    Interval
};
====
==list:begin==
->[Periodic]:  the interval \[0,1\] with periodic boundary conditions.
->[R]:    the whole real line.
->[Interval]:  the interval \[0,1\] (but not periodic boundary conditions).
==list:end==

==section:XType#XType==
An enumeration type we did not yet find a suitable name, so it's called XType so far. Intented to distinguish between B-splines and wavelets. Someone an idea for a name?
==code.cc==
enum XType {
    XBSpline,
    XWavelet
};
====

==section:Construction#Construction==
An enumeration to distinguish between different constructions of B-splines/wavelets.
==code.cc==
enum Construction {
    CDF,
    AnyInterval,
    DKU,
    Primbs,
    Dijkema
};
====
==list:begin==
->[CDF]:  the construction by Cohen, Daubechies, Faveau (on the real line).
->[AnyInterval]:    Any construction (out of [DKU, Primbs, Dijkema]) on the interval.
->[DKU]:  the construction by Dahmen, Kunoth, Urban.
->[Primbs]:    the construction by Primbs.
->[Dijkema]:    the construction by Dijkema.
==list:end==

==section:BoundaryCondition#BoundaryCondition==
An enumeration listing the different boundary conditions available for
interval bases. At the moment only homogenuous Dirichlet boundary conditions
are realized.
==code.cc==
enum BoundaryCondition {
    NoBC = 0,
    DirichletBC = 1,
};
